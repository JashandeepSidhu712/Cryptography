# NUMBER THEOREY
Number theory plays a crucial role in the field of cryptography, providing the mathematical foundation for various encryption and security algorithms. 

## PRIMALITY TESTING

Primality testing is the process of **determining whether a given positive integer (greater than 1) is a prime number or not**. 

Prime numbers are integers that have **exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves**. 

Primality testing is important in cryptography, particularly in algorithms like RSA, where the security relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors.
