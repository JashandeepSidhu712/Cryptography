# SUBSTITUTION TECHNIQUES

Substitution techniques are a category of classical encryption methods that involve <br>
**replacing one or more elements (usually letters or symbols) in the plaintext (the original message) <br>
with other elements to create ciphertext (the encrypted message)**. 

Substitution ciphers are relatively simple and are typically used for educational purposes or in situations where minimal security is required.

Substitution ciphers are relatively **weak and can be easily broken** using techniques like frequency analysis, where the frequency of letters or symbols in the ciphertext is analyzed to deduce the substitution pattern.
