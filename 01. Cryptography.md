# CRYPTOGRAPHY
Cryptography is a field that deals with **securing communication and information by converting it into an unreadable format**, <br>
making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access or understand the data.

# Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (normal, readable data) into ciphertext (encoded, unreadable data) <br> 
using a mathematical algorithm and an encryption key. 

Only those with the correct decryption key can revert the ciphertext back to plaintext.

# Decryption
Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where ciphertext is converted back into plaintext using a decryption algorithm and the correct decryption key.

# Cipher
Ciphertext is the **encrypted and unintelligible representation of plaintext** resulting of an encryption algorithm and a secret encryption key. 

It is designed to protect the **confidentiality and security of the original plaintext**, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized individuals or entities. 

Ciphertext is used in cryptography to ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data during transmission or storage. <br>
To recover the original plaintext and make it readable again, the corresponding decryption key and decryption algorithm must be applied.

# Symmetric Encryption
In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. 

The most common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

# Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: 
1. a public key for encryption and
2. a private key for decryption.

Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. 

RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are popular asymmetric encryption algorithms.

# Key
A key is a piece of information used as input to an encryption or decryption algorithm. 

In symmetric encryption, it is a single secret key, <br>
while in asymmetric encryption, it's a pair of public and private keys.

# Public Key
The public key is part of an asymmetric key pair and is used for encryption. It can be freely shared with anyone.

# Private Key
The private key is the other part of the asymmetric key pair and is kept secret. It is used for decryption and should never be shared.
