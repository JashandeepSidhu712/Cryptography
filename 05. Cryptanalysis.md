# BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS
A brute force attack is a straightforward and exhaustive method used to crack encryption or password protection. 

It involves **systematically attempting all possible combinations of characters or keys until the correct one is found**. 

Brute force attacks are typically time-consuming and resource-intensive, and their success depends on the length and complexity of the encryption key or password.

# CRYPTANALYSIS
Cryptanalysis is the study of **analyzing and breaking cryptographic systems**, often through **mathematical and analytical techniques**. 

The goal of cryptanalysis is to **find weaknesses or vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms** and <br>
**exploit them to recover the plaintext (original message) without knowledge of the decryption key**.
