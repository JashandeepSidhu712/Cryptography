# CAESAR CIPHER
The Caesar cipher is a simple and historic substitution cipher that **shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet**. 

This fixed number is known as the **"key" or "shift."**

### Encryption (Encoding):

Choose a shift value (key), which is an integer representing the number of positions to shift letters. <br>
Take the plaintext message that you want to encrypt.

For each letter in the plaintext: <br>
a. Determine its position in the alphabet. <br>
b. **Shift the letter forward in the alphabet by the key value**. <br>
c. If the shift goes beyond the end of the alphabet, wrap around to the beginning. <br>
d. Replace the original letter in the plaintext with the shifted letter to create the ciphertext.

Repeat this process for every letter in the plaintext. <br>

The resulting ciphertext is the encrypted message.

### Decryption (Decoding):

Choose the same shift value (key) that was used for encryption. <br>
Take the ciphertext message that you want to decrypt.

For each letter in the ciphertext: <br>
a. Determine its position in the alphabet. <br>
b. **Shift the letter backward in the alphabet by the key value**. <br>
c. If the shift goes before the beginning of the alphabet, wrap around to the end. <br>
d. Replace the letter in the ciphertext with the shifted letter to retrieve the original plaintext letter. <br>

Repeat this process for every letter in the ciphertext.

The resulting plaintext is the decrypted message.

In the classic Caesar cipher, **there are only 25 possible keys to try** <br>
because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and if you shift the letters by 26 positions, you end up with the original alphabet. 

Since a shift of 0 (no shift) doesn't change the plaintext, <br>
and a shift of 26 is the same as a shift of 0, you only need to try keys from 1 to 25 to cover all possible Caesar cipher keys.
