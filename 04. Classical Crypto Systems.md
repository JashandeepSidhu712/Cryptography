# CLASSICAL CRYPTO SYSTEMS
Classical cryptographic systems refer to **historical methods of encrypting and decrypting messages** that were developed and used before the modern era of computer-based encryption. 

These systems are primarily based on mathematical algorithms and techniques and were used to secure communications and protect sensitive information.

## Substitution Ciphers:

Substitution ciphers replace each letter in the plaintext with another letter or symbol. Common examples include the Atbash cipher, where letters are reversed in the alphabet, and the ROT13 cipher, which shifts letters by 13 positions.

## Caesar Cipher:

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. <br>
It involves **shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet**. <br>
It's a type of substitution cipher.

## Transposition Ciphers:

Transposition ciphers involve **rearranging the order of letters in the plaintext without changing the actual letters themselves**. 

Examples include the Rail Fence cipher and the Columnar Transposition cipher.

## Playfair Cipher:

The Playfair cipher uses a 5x5 grid of letters to encrypt plaintext by replacing pairs of letters with other pairs according to specific rules.

## Columnar Transposition Cipher:

This is a transposition cipher that rearranges the letters of the plaintext according to a keyword, which determines the column order.
