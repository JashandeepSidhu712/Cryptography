# SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Security Architecture outlines a structured approach to securing computer networks and communication systems. 

It defines various layers, security services, mechanisms, and potential attacks.

## SECURITY SERVICES

Security services are the fundamental building blocks of information security. They are the high-level functions that provide protection to computer systems, data, and communication channels from various threats and risks.

1. Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or systems.
2. Access Control: Managing and restricting access to resources based on authorization policies.
3. Confidentiality: Ensuring data remains private and protected from unauthorized access.
4. Integrity: Guaranteeing that data remains accurate and unaltered.
6. Availability: Ensuring systems and resources are available and accessible.

## SECURITY MECHANISM

Security mechanisms are specific techniques or methods used to implement security services. They are the technical tools and processes that protect information and systems.

1. Cryptography: Encryption, decryption, and hashing to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
2. Firewalls: Network devices that control and monitor traffic based on security policies.
3. Access Control Lists (ACLs): Lists of permissions to regulate access to resources.
4. Digital Signatures: Verification of the authenticity and integrity of digital messages.
6. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Framework for managing digital keys and certificates.
7. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS): Protocols for secure communication over the internet.

## SECURITY ATTACKS

Security attacks are deliberate, unauthorized actions or attempts to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, availability, or other security aspects of computer systems, data, or networks.

1. Unauthorized Access: Gaining access to systems or data without permission.
2. Eavesdropping: Intercepting and listening to communications or data without consent.
3. Data Modification: Unauthorized alteration or manipulation of data.
4. Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading a system or network to disrupt services.
5. Spoofing: Faking the identity of a user or device.
6. Data Theft: Unauthorized copying or theft of sensitive information.
7. Malware: Software designed to harm or compromise systems (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojans).
